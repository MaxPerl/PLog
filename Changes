	-> Complete implementation of a new structure:
	-> All the informations about Static and Blog Content now are generated from the PLog/Generator Scripts
	The PLog (GUI) Module is only a wrapper around the objects generated from the Generator Scripts instead of creating own objects in PLog::StaticContent etc.
	
	-> The UI components are more modularized (PLog::UI::StaticContent, PLog::UI::BlogContent) for easier maintaining
	-> Minor bug fixes
	-> Minor enhancements in the Generator scripts
	-> The software is still ALPHA and the Blog Part cannot used at the moment (Perhaps changes in the syntax are possible!)
